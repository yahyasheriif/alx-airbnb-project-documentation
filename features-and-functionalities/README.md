# Airbnb Clone Backend Project Requirements

## Objective

This document outlines the key features and functionalities required for the Airbnb Clone backend. It details the technical and functional aspects necessary to build a scalable, secure, and robust system.

---

## Introduction

Backend development powers web applications by handling server-side logic, managing databases, and integrating APIs. This document focuses on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, emphasizing features that ensure functionality, user-friendliness, and efficiency.

Requirements are categorized into:

- **Core Functionalities**
- **Technical Requirements**
- **Non-Functional Requirements**

---

## Core Functionalities

The backend must support the following essential features, typical of a rental marketplace:

### 1. User Management

- **User Registration**
  - Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
  - Use secure authentication (e.g., JWT).
- **User Login and Authentication**
  - Login via email and password.
  - Support OAuth (Google, Facebook) for convenience.
- **Profile Management**
  - Users can update profiles, including photos, contact info, and preferences.

### 2. Property Listings Management

- **Add Listings**
  - Hosts can create new property listings with details (title, description, location, price, amenities, availability).
- **Edit/Delete Listings**
  - Hosts can update or remove their listings.

### 3. Search and Filtering

- **Search Functionality**
  - Users can search properties by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly, etc.).
- **Pagination**
  - Efficiently handle and display large search result sets.

### 4. Booking Management

- **Booking Creation**
  - Guests can book properties for specific dates.
  - Validate dates to prevent double bookings.
- **Booking Cancellation**
  - Guests and hosts can cancel bookings, following a cancellation policy.
- **Booking Status Tracking**
  - Track statuses: pending, confirmed, canceled, completed.

### 5. Payment Integration

- **Secure Payment Gateways**
  - Integrate with Stripe, PayPal, etc.
  - Manage upfront payments and automatic payouts to hosts.
- **Multi-Currency Support**
  - Handle transactions in multiple currencies.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings

- **Guest Reviews**
  - Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Host Responses**
  - Hosts can respond to reviews.
- **Abuse Prevention**
  - Link reviews to bookings to prevent fraudulent/unverified reviews.

### 7. Notifications System

- **Communication**
  - Email and in-app notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, payment updates, etc.

### 8. Admin Dashboard

- **Management Interface**
  - Admins can monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Use a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- Required tables: Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, Payments.

### 2. API Development

- **RESTful APIs**
  - Expose all backend functionalities via RESTful APIs.
  - Use proper HTTP methods and status codes.
- **GraphQL (Optional)**
  - Consider GraphQL for complex/efficient data fetching.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Secure User Sessions**
  - Use JWT for session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Define permissions for Guests, Hosts, Admins.

### 4. File Storage

- Store property images and profile photos using cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.).

### 5. Third-Party Services

- Integrate with email providers (SendGrid, Mailgun) for notifications.

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement comprehensive global error handling for all APIs.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

- **Modular Architecture**
  - Design for easy scaling as user traffic increases.
- **Horizontal Scaling**
  - Support horizontal scaling (e.g., load balancers).

### 2. Security

- **Data Encryption**
  - Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payments).
- **Threat Prevention**
  - Use firewalls, rate limiting, etc.

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Caching**
  - Use Redis or similar for frequently accessed data.
- **Query Optimization**
  - Optimize database queries for performance.

### 4. Testing

- **Automated Testing**
  - Implement unit and integration tests (e.g., with pytest).
  - Include automated API testing.
